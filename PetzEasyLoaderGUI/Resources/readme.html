		<h1>Welcome to Petz EZLoader</h1>
		<h2>your simple petz mod management system</h2>

		<hr />

		<h3>DISCLAIMER:</h3>
		<p>
			PetzEL is designed to modify content in your petz Resource folders, so before using it BACK UP THOSE FOLDERS. I am not responsible if this program overwrites or deletes any important files
			you decided to store in those folders, or otherwise breaks your game.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<h3>Installation Instructions:</h3>

		<p>
			<span class="bold">IMPORTANT:</span> If your Petz .exe is configured to "Run as Administrator", PetzEL must also be run as administrator! Otherwise PetzEL will not be able to automatically
			start the game.
		</p>

		<p>
			To install PetzEL, simply extract the PetzEL installation .zip into any non-Program Files directory, such as your "Documents" folder. Upon first launch, the program will automatically open
			the settings menu. There, you will be prompted to select the .exe file for the Petz/Babyz game you wish to use with PetzEL. PetzEL currently supports Petz 3, 4, 5 and Babyz. After that,
			you can adjust the settings to you liking, then click "Save and Start Petz" to launch the game.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once you have completed this initial setup, PetzEL will not open the settings menu and skip straight to loading the game unless the "Always Open Settings" option is checked. However, you
			can always open the settings menu again by double clicking the "modify_setting.bat" file included in the installation directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			In order for the PetzEL seasons feature to work properly, it is recommended that you alway use PetzEL to launch your game. If you'd like, you can create a shortcut to PetzEL and rename it
			to whichever game version you're running, and change the icon to one of the included Petz icon files
		</p>
		<p>
			If you wish to use PetzEL with more than one P.F. Magic game, you can have multiple installations on one computer, all configured to run different games. Just make sure the files being
			loaded match the game version you're running!
		</p>

		<h3>Auto Scene Swapping Instructions</h3>

		<p>
			PetzEL isn't just a content management system. It actually adds new features to the game! By checking your computers date and time and automatically swapping out playscenes before loading
			the game, it creates the illusion that Petz 3/4 and Babyz have real time seasons and weather.
		</p>
		<p>
			Setting up this feature is easy. Simply copy the playscenes you wish to be used for each season, time of day, and weather type into the corresponding folder in the SeasonalArea directory
			and PetzEL will handle the rest! If a folder is missing a copy of a particular scene, the game will load whichever version of that scene was last in the game, so it's not nessicary to fill
			all the folders if you don't want.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each of the 3 scene swapping features as has a number of configuration options. If you wish to only use some of the auto scene swapping features, you can use the "force" options to make
			PetzEZLoader always use a particular folder. For seasons, you can tweak the start and end date of each season.
		</p>
		<p>
			For time, you can set the sunrise and sunset times, and also choose whether you want to use to optional sunrise and sunset scenes. This will use scenes in the sunrise and sunset folders
			during the sunrise and sunset hours, rather than switching directly to day or night.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, the weather type has 3 different loading options. "Random on load" will select a random weather effect each time you load the game. "Random per day" will select a random weather
			effect once per day, and load that weather effect each time you open the game. "Location based" will attempt to mirror the weather at the provided longitude and latitude coordinates via
			the Open-Metero API. If you don't know your personal longitude and latitude coordinates, they can be found with a simple google search.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now, this feature would be pretty useless without scenes to go with it, and thankfully the lovely ButterflyChaser has stepped up and has been hard at work creating a full set of scenes to
			work with the EZLoader! These should be available for download at both <a href="https://oodlecat.meowandsparkle.party/alive-enough/" target="_blank">my site</a> and
			<a href="https://butterflyfieldz.neocities.org/" target="_blank">ButterflyChaser's site</a>. It's also possible than in the future other people will decide to create EZLoader compatible scenes, so make
			sure to check out my site for more details.
		</p>

		<h3>Bulk Loading Instructions</h3>

		<p>
			Have tons of custom Petz content to manage? Sick of having to copy files back and forth out of your game? Well, PetzEL is here to help! With bulk loading, PetzEL will enable you to add and
			remove entire folders full of content from the Resource folder, all with the click of a button!
		</p>

		<p>
			To get started, create a new folder in the "Files" directory. Then, sort the files you want to add into their respective resource folders. PetzEL will default to including any new content
			you add, so next time you start the game, the new files should be there.
		</p>

		<p>
			To remove content, simply open up the PetzEL setting and move whichever folder you'd like to remove from the "Remove" section. PetzEL will then automatically remove the files in those
			folders from your game directory.
		</p>

		<p>
			Note: if you wish to delete a folder in your PetzEL directory, make sure to mark it as Removed from within PetzEL first! Otherwise, you will have to remove the content from your game
			manually, as PetzEL only removes files contained within the folders in its "Removed" section, and ignores all other files.
		</p>

		<hr />

		<h3>Tips and Tricks</h3>

		<p>
			Content is loaded in the following order: <br />
			Seasonal Area > Remove Files > Included Files, in the order they are listed in the setting page
		</p>

		<p>
			PetzEL supports OW breeds! However, if you remove a folder containing OW breeds, make sure you have a folder containing the original version of those breeds in the included files.
			Otherwise, PetzEL won't know to replace the originals.
